# Crime_analysis-on-US-States-and-its-Territory

Using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) skills, on structured time series dataset sourced from Wikipedia. This dataset tracks violent crime incidents per state over several years. The goal of this assignment is to harness the power of data to unravel insights and tell a compelling story about crime in the United States. Through the use of Python's data manipulation, visualization, and analytical capabilities, I unlock the hidden patterns within the data and gain a deeper understanding of the fluctuations in crime rates over time and across different regions.
